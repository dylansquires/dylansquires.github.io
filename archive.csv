08/02/2023,Our Echoes,"I 

Our echoes sound to us from humble past,
Forgotten yells from Death, their calls will last.
I air, no final say shall Death have here,
These words will breathe the life from Deathly bier.

II 

The pen in hand, to start the story here,
To set the scene, picture the ancient year,
In seven-nine, from lands from over sea, 
A Roman scout looks forth, a ford to see.
A place to call their home, Veratinum.
An army marches, soldiers bang the drum.
With foreign magic, unknown hypocaust
To warm their homes, to keep out deadly frost.
You see the North is harsh, more so than Rome,
But it’s the people’s warmth that forges Home.
It’ll take time to form, like pottery
At BRICO’s wheel, lovingly spun by he.
With soft and gentle hands, on earthen clay
That gives a second birth a later day.
Through eyes of clay, we see the tragic act,
Now unearthed and risen, their play intact.
And off they fly on wings of owls to greet
Their goddess Minerva, their life complete.
The year four-o-seven, this town is left,
Abandoned fragile bones all lay to rest.

III

And after Alaric’s grave sack of Rome
Came raids from Picts whose strength and threat had grown.
From north of Firth of Forth, they marched down south
To plunder weakened land where lies the scouth.
Enlisted soldiers, foederati sailed
Across the Northern Sea, the Picts assailed.
Revolt - now burnt relations on the wane. 	
On Mount Badon the Kings glory did reign,
As Brits had slayed the Anglo-Saxon men,
The Kingdoms ruled by Arthur and fair Gwen.
On eastern coast, up north of Humber wave,
A kingdom split in two, like church by nave.
A son born six-o-four, to rule Bernice,
To Æthelfrith, whose death put death to peace.
In Dalriada, Oswald, exiled there,
A son of God, converted, turned to prayer.
The years of youth now gone, at Heavenfield
saintly Oswald raised the Holy shield.
‘Let’s pray *all kneeled* in God’s almighty grace,
His mercy defends us in this here place.’
With dawn of day, they marched – O glory be!
To reunited Christianity.
At death. ‘O Lord, have mercy on their souls.’
His flame extinguished left now only coals.
Through God, before his end at Maserfield,
A church he built for Elphin - holy bield.
His friend from isles from Inner Hebrides
With saintly ways, devout austerities.
On horse’s back now Elphin must go ride
To Waeringtun, the Word of God to guide.
His name of mythology, Welsh of root
From poems young Taliesin bore in fruit.
In legend, Elphin found the boy esprit,
Taliesin, wet with spume of Dylan’s sea.

IV

The years a whisper, shrouded dark, the times
And Ages lost, to echo final chimes.
His house of God in Doomsday written to
Le chevalier du Poitou, terre anew.
From soil, erected castle, Norman built;
The Mount, a flower, time did slowly wilt.
In final days, the Lord le Boteler,
With wine now waned, no more for timber fir.
The bridges built, the Royal Charter waxed,
The sun now bright, the darkened clouds now lapsed.
A Berber saint of royal harbor life,
Confessions, sinful youth was left in seif.
For wisdom, theological he sought,
Still yet years later, words of his still taught.
From blood of Bot’ler, The Friary did rise
On umber clay, a shadow faintly ties.
Through cloisters, blessed Austin monks all stroll
With tongues all tied in verses to extol.
Time turning quick round corners newly paved,
In Penketh streets, a wick of life ablaze.
For Cambridge streets, scholarly Penketh rode.
A master’s in theology bestowed,
Yet soon was sailing for Italia
And given public chair in Padua.
But today Shakespeare keeps his name alive
In tales of Kings corrupt, he did survive.
The wick now out, the friar wilts and dies,
As clocks now strike and grammar schools now rise.

V

A figure cloaked in black, with scythe in hand
With grimace, cold, brings tears across the land.
Still, we open the gates to let in Death
As civil war brings men their final breath.
An ugly truth as old as time itself,
All history a mirror for the self.
The state of monarchy in woes
So now the church still bears its blows.
They storm, these men of war, to tear down peace
These men of Ares, deathless, never cease,
And stand in bronze, their passing feet to stay
In towns where victors lose whilst heads decay.
The Cromwell’s interregnum short in reign,
And Britain’s ruling blood runs blue again.
First Earl, another title name to claim,
Of Warrington - a rose, what’s in a name?
Through wealth of copper, quickly came to be
The town that stands on Patten’s industry,
With Bank Hall standing tall on money made
By Patten off the back of veiled slave trade.
Designed by Gibbs of Radcliffe Camera, but fame
Will never overshadow years of pain.
The papers hot with news, a fresh dispatch,
The Warrington Academy to match
The likes of grander places further south,
A place for nonconformists. Like the mouth
Of rivers, flowing fast towards a sea
Where knowledge infinite can set you free.
The school’s financial problems did fester,
But lives today as Harris Manchester.

VI

In brick the name still there, Joseph Crosfield
& Sons, at Bank Quay where once soap was sealed.
As economy booms the town connects,
To the larger cities it bisects.
Transport now via rail lines open to 
The working masses with much to do,
And so too opens England’s very first
Public library, built for bookish thirst.
Whilst thirst for gold in far Australian mines
Had prompted ships be built for White Star Line.
RMS Tayleur built Titanic-like,
Although no brooding iceberg did it strike.
In fog and storm, the crew, now lost, confound
The south for west, and soon they ran aground.
Back home, a young carpenter, blessed by fates,
Gave Warrington it’s famous Golden Gates.
Fit for a Queen, they shine victorious
As Nike glistens, always glorious.
In vict’ry over fascists whose regimes
Came tumbling at the cost of young boy’s dreams.
The roar of engines deafened BAD 1 ears
Now somber cenotaph marks down the years.
And still more young boy’s dreams are left to rack
And ruin from a terrorist attack.

VII

Is history then just a list of deaths?
The whispers, coldly heard, of ghostly breaths?
Or will we change our history and make
It beautifully ours? Is this our wake?",Poem
08/02/2023,Cathedral of Limestone,"This Stone that we face with heads all
Titled up in awe,
We clasp our hands,
We curl our fingers tight,
As it is for moments
Like this we pray for. Praying day
Does not vanish to night,
So that the quartz, like stained glass,
Can glisten upon us forever.
We rejoice for this here heaven,
Each crevice a cella,
Up each vault line as if flying
Together, again.",Poem
08/02/2023,The Stars,"Like a hand reaching out through time
Through an ancient void
Of the vastest black,
Speckles of the universe’s history
Are painted across a darkening
Blue canvas sky…

And they shine pinned
To the dome that separates us
From those celestial lights,
Whilst we are shaken in this globe.

But now the sun has set,
And we crepuscular souls
Move through our degrees -
Of freedoms that we grant ourselves,
Whilst all that was civil becomes astronomical.

And the night grips my heart tight
As we stand on top of the roof
Looking out towards limpid horizons…
The whispers of smoke rise high
As we read out our xinshi
Looking up towards the stars.",Poem
08/02/2023,My Bed Like a Careless Lover,"My bed like a careless lover
soothes me when I need it not
still I doze in the
tangled embrace
of a million threads that
spin the dream wheel.",Poem
08/02/2023,In Frau Möller,"In Frau Möller,
The wood darkens to a richer shade
Of red-tinted brown,
As the light bubbles through the
Froth of beers.

In Frau Möller,
The bartender pulls pints of every
Colour that could be,
And is, possible from simple Deutschland
Grains and hops.

In Frau Möller,
The voices slide into the atmosphere,
Fitting softly
Into the seats and corners of walls
That show their age.

In Frau Möller,
The food that sailors brought to land
Fills cavernous
Stomachs, that though emptied from the day,
Grumble no more.

In Frau Möller,
The waitress kicks the door open,
With her hands full
Of plates stacked upon plates
For those outside.

In Frau Möller,
The rain beats down on the awning,
As a women
Runs across the drowned street and her
Trench-coat trails her heels.

In Frau Möller,
The last potato is ferried around
A lake of sauce,
Before the man shows his gratitude with words
I don’t understand.

In Frau Möller,
I utter my final danke and pull on
My battered blazer,
And whilst my feet head towards home,
My heart remains

In Frau Möller.",Poem
08/02/2023,Rothiemurchus,"…and as the sun melts
Behind the trees of Rothiemurchus,
You taste it’s last liquid butter
Hit your lips.

…and you sit there with your back
Against the roots,
Knowing that this is the last
That this summer sun has to offer

…and the brindled upland
Remains as ever, standing still,
But it’s lost a lover
For whom it will cry for until the next

…and tomorrow the bus leaves early
From the edge of this sanctum,
Returning back to a home
From which you can remember

Always.",Poem
08/02/2023,Yorkshire,"A poem is penned, 
The spine a memory,
In need of urgent mend,
But what will be, will be.

A house that’s full of noise,
The ruckus bouncing from wall
To wall, it’s just the girls
All running through the hall.

Family gathers round,
All sitting up to eat,
As rain hits hard, the sound
Outside a drumming beat.

The mouse, he seeks to find
A nook, a cranny, for 
A little peace of mind,
So quick, behind the door.",Poem
24/02/2023,Per Rovida,"Inside the margins of the day,
un giorno che si sveglia con cannella
e crema,
a sign, a joy, beneath the climbing vines
ed onde di brioche dolce di Rovida.

The same smile as always,
these last few days:
un espresso preso lentamente,
dentro la fine dell’anno.
[Broken sentences understood]

Tutto le cose d’oro-
ogni fiocco di mattina, spero di salvare,
e quindi
we sit together, around the coffee table,
again, just as yesterday went.
Una tradizione del momento.

These chapters, written in teal,
leggere di nuovo con occhi più vecchi,
over the crumbs,
of an already finished pastry-
il mio cuore rimane.",Poem
26/02/2023,I Have Noticed,"I have noticed 
as I have gotten older
my teeth yellow further
with each cup of coffee day
after day - the years stacked up - and
I am just like those
second-hand books on my shelf
stained with a cracked
and wrinkled spine with a 
bookmark I had forgotten I’d left
in there
only a few chapters in.",Poem
03/03/2023,Vedo un'Alba,"vedo un’alba
e poi parlo le parole
ma poi
cos’è questa vita vista
ma parole
il contrasto sulla pagina bianca
le parole mai vedute 
mai parlate
parole per noi
e poi
vediamo un’alba
almeno… almeno.",Poem
05/03/2023,How Many Times Must I Brush My Teeth,"This is the third 
time and
it’s only midday.
I can’t –
the taste of coffee,
dead grounds, just
lingering
there and I… fuck
I used
to love that feeling:
why today, what’s changed?
I’ll spit the flavour
(still sweet)
in a phlegmy ball of toothpaste
foaming
down
down the sink:
that’ll do it.
still 3- and 4- 
caffeoylquinic acids
wrap around my tongue,
twisting themselves between 
my teeth.
a slight numbness,
anxious at why these thoughts
teethe,
pushing against the roof
of my skull.
I’m sure if you were
to grind my skull,
it would come out stained
with hues of almond,
caramel and cinnamon 
but not…
not even close to an 
off, milky white.
still
I see you there,
stood waiting for your cup
as if yesterday never
set foot outside the door,
as I still cup my hands
holding the dust of my skull.",Poem
22/04/2023,"You Are a Poem, Untranslatable","You are a poem, untranslatable,
stuck between foreign words 
and characters. Enchanted spells
so ancient even the universe cannot
fathom you.

In vain, you’ll try to read,
to understand,
to scratch and pick at
the letters that have found themselves
a home - buried in the cracks
of the wrinkles of your skin.

And time will grow old, as it has always
done, 
and you’ll wait until the balloon 
pops,
hoping it’ll reveal some sacred wisdom
from inside. Instead,
the secrets of your heart will scatter themselves
across the night sky to read,
hidden behind a language you 
forgot long ago. 

You are a poem, untranslatable,
so, at best, all those shimmering crystals,
hung on threads in the deep-blue,
all they can do
is to light up your eyes
to the beauty that is you.",Poem
25/04/2023,Like a Broken Piece of Peanut,"Like a broken piece of peanut
stuck, wedged between two teeth
at the back of my jaw -
that’s what it feels like.
So instead I wish some god
would turn me into a leaf.
A single leaf lost from its tree,
so that a great wind would
whip me up and whisk me far away.

But my skin is see-through
and I can already see those
leafy veins. I am already where 
I am meant to be.",Poem
01/05/2023,May Day,"It’s all happening today—
May Day, followed by a one hour nap.
Then them drums of Morris dancers
THUDDING through dreamers’ curtains—
The heavy smell of bad bread.
Well, I’ve had worse, though I 
feel like I’m treading…
waiting for a cobble to fall through.
Though I’ve had worse. It’s true.
Time to let Fate’s bow blow a whole
and split me in two.",Poem
01/05/2023,Deserted,"What will you do
when you find yourself deserted,
not by friends or family,
but deserted by you?
As if the glue, holding the rubber 
of your shoe has melted—
left behind in the cracks 
of the streetstones.
Would you run back,
scrape it all back up,
then would you feel good?
Or would you stop, and sit outside,
to sip-slow, under the awning
outside a coffee shop,
with the sun just peeking through 
and warming
that torn heartbeat of you?",Poem
02/05/2023,For Iðunn,"Last night we talked and took flight
and found ourselves- by luck-
on solid ground where we slipped between
the pages of bound books: dog-eared 
and bruised by the ages.
And we talked, walking into
the past, under lights too dim, too 
blurred, but, in the books we took,
we heard the call: 
“I was young like you, youth-tall,
with a lifebuzz hung from the tip of my finger. 
Go sing to her and hold her in your palm.
She won’t ring her charms forever.”

Morning whistles and Sun hauls the dawn
of another day. Go see how the river runs,
and in the eyot, see how Iðunn plays.",Poem
10/05/2023,Scenes From the North,"I
We wrestle wind of Irish Sea
Atop red raw sandstone,
And gusts that wail like ghostly gales,
A far, far cry from home.
Grass purls,
The fading coastline hurls
Past tales,
Crashing from mouths of caves.
All of it now a memory,
Washed out and veiled by waves.

II
In valleys hollowed by glaciers
We walk where ages passed.
Two faint silhouettes slip and lurch
On the fells that outlast.
Giants
Turn men to marching ants,
Who search
For tarn ‘tween crag and rigg,
A sanctum in Mother Nature’s
Embrace, sweet as a fig.

III
Scampering swift over loose stone,
Falling fast from above,
With feet that weave over water,
Twisting towards the Dove.
Alive,
A sweet and sticky hive.
Shorter
Steps, the path leads up high,
As summer sun gives one last groan,
Waking a moonlit sky.

IV
The fells, in Kronos’s shadow,
Down by the reservoir,
Where the rocky trail tries to hold
Onto what still is our
Warm heart,
Beating for lakes we part.
But bold
In view, the Yorkshire dales,
Over which we trav’lers now go,
Rolling on with hay bales.

V
A path, through Yorkshire, of limestone,
A pavement from weather.
Food for acid rain under feet.
In the dales of heather,
(Harebells,
Too) the wildflower smells
So sweet,
Its fresh scent a clear wave,
Watering seeds of friendship sown,
Passing Robin Hood’s grave.

VI
On the hill, creeping into sight,
In the Eden valley,
Where a troop of cairns march on east,
More miles to the tally.
The Nine
Mark the lost borderline,
Where beasts
With devilish horns brawl.
But at the sight of those cairns, fright
Enters the eyes of all.
 
VII
Left behind, the sheep of Swaledale,
Sheep of foreign Holland,
Those Texel sheep with heavy heads,
Now stand on brawny land.
A vein,
The Swale cuts through terrain
That spreads,
Gaia’s hardened tissue
Squeezing out walkers that exhale
As Richmond comes in view.

VIII
Light illuminates the painting.
The sun burning up high,
Turns fields to flaxen gold shades
With strokes of coloured dye.
A sea
Of lapis lazuli,
That fades
Through the sky’s blues over
Malachite hedgerows, bordering
The frame lit up solar.

IX
Wheat fields replaced and left behind.
Ahead, snaking sandstone
Slides through fields of purple heather,
Whilst heat swells and cracks bone.
Sweat leaks,
As veins bulge, forming peaks.
Feathers
From owls, stuck into hats,
To shade the Sun’s tightening bind,
As pheasants run down tracks.

X
The trail levels out, turning black.
Levelling out, turning
Back the time to cinders and shale.
And the ground starts burning,
This path,
Subject to human wrath.
So frail,
Birds squawk, a broken wing,
And our screaming world turns to black,
Our requiem to sing.

XI
Through Oberon’s forest, the day
Tires as the sun dapples
Its warming touch through emerald leaves.
Each ray floats, unravels
Along
The rushing water’s song,
And weaves
Between trees that echo
The sound of dell-fairies who play,
Innocent and mellow.

XII
Ghostly mist from Northern Sea veils
Eastern coast in myst’ry,
As wandering souls creep onwards,
Burying injury.
The shore
Sings the tail of the score
With words
That sink into my chest,
Falling with the final exhale,
As time rides the wave’s crest.",Poem
10/05/2023,Pecorino Poem,"Sometimes, when I’m slicing off flakes of 
pecorino for my pasta,
I get lost in the cheese
and begin to think that I’m some great
renaissance sculptor, carving at
marble, making a masterpiece;
and before I know it,
I have enough
pecorino for my pasta.
You might think this is a poem 
about enjoying the process,
(the journey, not the end)
but it’s not. 
I just like Italian cheese.",Poem
13/05/2023,It's All Over the Cemetery Stones,"Fox covered on the hill,
we sat in your old car
facing the dusk covered town
with a duffle bag in the backseat,
thinking of our ill crowns-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

By the grey canal
you said you hated the sound
but we laughed at the birds
drowning in their riches
as you didn’t want a lover-
it’s all over the cemetery stones

Meeting under the chemical plant,
though I never had a job
you looked at me with fallen eyes,
while the violet eye wept 
tears for the daffodils to grow-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

You got stuck on the weekend hours, 
but you could pluck me away
under the broken streets,
or to where we got lost
in the palmed backstreets-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

Walking under the underpass,
you would push and pull
at the threads of my jumper
as your hair rode the wind
and the wind rode the train-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

At the traveller’s fair,
we tore up our tickets
for a chance to sing
in the cellar under the pub,
knocking on the backs of chairs-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

Midnight punched a hole 
through your breast
as we lay in our insides
by candlelight we rose-blushed,
the twilight on our cheeks-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

Ask me if I still care
and I’ll sit back with a beer,
reading through the gaps
of your fingers on the book 
we bought from the store-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

The land left swollen sick,
you cried at the phone
but I know it’s true
as I watched the groom 
carry his feet from the church-
it’s all over the cemetery stones.

If this is all there was,
if you knew from the start,
if I ran across the mersey’s estuary,
if the herons all took love in flight,
if we looked with milky eyes-
it’d be all over the cemetery stones.",Poem
17/05/2023,The Days Feel Loose,"the days feel loose
as if the weeks ahead
are merely balls of wool
waiting to be knitted
made into some great thing
but they’ve been thrown about
a little too much
and so they’ve unraveled themselves
slowly… slowly
for some reason
it’s fallen to me
to be the knitter of these days
though I know 
loose days
are easier to thread
into tomorrow’s tapestry",Poem
19/05/2023,Silicon Mind,"“Maybe I’m going to live forever

20/05/2023,A Streak of Red,"Over the back of my hand,
a bug,
smaller than a freckle,
dotted and redotted
red.

I tried to pick
the lil’ guy
up, roll him
onto another finger,
but he refused,
running around,
away.

So I brushed him
off,
and he landed
on the wooden
table.
Still.

I thought I’d killed him,
I, death-cloaked,
creaked a bony nail
towards
the red
dot.

Then, in an instance,
streaked
across the 
wood,
the remains.

Others might think
the mark to be
the ink
of a pen,
but I know 
what happened
here.",Poem
23/05/2023,The Patchwork Stones,"The patchwork stones

across the golden stones,
that’s when magic fills the eyes.",Poem
23/05/2023,They Fall Between the Leaves,"they fall between the leaves
dappled droplets of emerald
glossed light
dripping through
drawing up from a well
buried deep in the insides 
where things in the dark lie
fast asleep
snoring steadily on blankets
with hearts rising and falling on beat
and they rise
lifting their heads
from slumber
soaring out through the throat
singing to the skies
harmonising in blissful 
strawberry scented songs
they fall between the leaves
these moments of introspection
reaching beyond the skin
reaching with a hand 
that will wrap itself around 
curling fingers
in an eternal embrace",Poem
28/05/2023,Brookes,"There’s a room
at the climbing gym,
a room between two others;
sandwiched
and rainbow peppered in holds.
Some in luminous greens
oranges
yellows or
reds,
like stained glass
telling a story
not fully told-
told only in a few images spaced
decisively by a creator.

And everyone’s gripped, 
hooked,
even if only to slow down their gait,
to lift a head back,
to strain a neck,
flicking an eye,
chipping their mind
across the possibilities,
just briefly-
a little, internal mutter.
Paused static
in thought.

Some walk through this
room
and head off to the next,
off in search of something else
but some stay and flake out rope
and up and off
they go in search
of heaven on earth.",Poem

Too many, too many emails to even think about:

Emails flying on paper airplanes darting through the air,

02/06/2023,Exam Season Monsoon,"Exam season’s like a monsoon-
air changes- we evaporate,
turned into mushy clouds of gloom
with stress ridden hair our lone crown.

Desks we once knew now leftovers;
veiled in hurried meals, coffeed notes,
the crumbs mask any wooden odors,
past papers- hole punched, bruised inkblue.

Gown draped students all march indoors;
it’s ironic then that the sun
comes out, seducing sweet amours-
the nude sky atop Exam Schools.

But we raindanced this performance
that others watch outside the queue,
peering at white tied conformance
knowing that they too will dance soon

to this exam season monsoon.",Poem
06/06/2023,White Carnations,"Students in white carnations merge
in Schools: the arrow pointing left,
a subfusc murmuration surge,
and through they go, pens bleeding sweat.

The first, a paper lay down dead,
all thinking washed to muddy grey,
all thought in six-feet-under dread:
the voice above heads starts the test.

O great almighty time ers on,
as pens stu-stutter over desks,
the blackened crossings, answers gone,
as time is blowing out the flame.

The man, he bellows deep with air,
and sighs all wisp from tired souls,
they seated still with frozen wear,

11/06/2023,Pink Carnations,"In gutters, pink carnations bleed,
the thunder-sky in flashing, deep
and grumbling groans, aloud they heed-
tonight is black in brooding dark.

The desk are lit by lamplight glow,
the mind withdraws beneath the rain,
as lightning cracks the roof to woe,
the crumbs of knowledge left to fade.

The days are turned to eves, and sleep
becomes a cradle, prising through
the straining daylight, letting seep,
in tired souls, a gentle calm.

The dawn washes through the windows,
the ties retied, the gowns again
are draped, students again in flows,
and knowledge blossoms from the seed,

as pink, ink washed carnations bleed.",Poem
16/06/2023,Red Carnations ,"Your red carnations thrown aside
as you go singing out of Schools,
the stress now leaving like a tide
that slowly washes from your mind.

And all that fills the days from here
are thoughts and plans of summer songs
so to the meadow drinking beer
with friends all sat around who say,

“congratulations!” and “well done!”
and “come on in, the water’s great!”
so in you dive with soaring sun
a-blazing from the roaring sky.

As morning calls and parents come
to pick up the students, like kids,
who’s time is up, the play now done,
with goodbyes and farewells, all sighed,

the red carnations curled and died.",Poem

04/07/2023,The Winter Just Gone Was Warm,"Roses bloomed polychromatic, rooted in
the atrium, beating through the aorta.

Daisies were hand-in-hand, wrapped
around the cerebellum and cerebrum.

Tulips danced and swayed, finding 
themselves between the fascicles of muscle.

from lunate to proximal to distal.

11/07/2023,In Hours of Dayfaded and Darkest Shade,"In hours of dayfaded and darkest shade,
I move through, breaking candlelight in two,
And pause in my own shadow of Man,
Who brings himself to rise with shoulders drawn
Out, broader than the door that shuts the sky,
The starry light, away for sleep to fall.
And he, the shadow, looks to me with blank
Eyes, stretching over head. But what of it,
This bestial moment that wicks from time,
That has already flickered out to sleep?

Will I, when morning breaks, that lonely star,
That angelic island of blazing heat,
Be steadfast facing every trial strong
In mind and muscle, strained like iron true
To nature, bound by rock, where found is strength
That flows upwards from the eternal well?
Now watch and bear your sight to starlings flocked,
A greater shadow, brilliant in flight,
And wing to wing we’ll soar past Saturn’s height,
Adorned and robed in great armour of light.",Poem

where the rock can’t crawl

moved to you
trusted to you 
it gushes from the mountain’s crown
where thirst is left long buried
and dead-still

a transition: from one plane to the next
in a stateless state
twisted in the movement
come here where the feeling 
of soft zephyr spreads its wings
to blanket
love wishes you this

from the cradling nest of a grivet
the fossa slinks it’s way loose
to find itself bushy under umbels
of chelidonium
as spring leaks into the orange sap
of summer’s sphere

27/07/2023,"When the Rain Pours, I Go Walking","When the rain pours, I go walking
and I look at how the concrete fills the sky,
tracing the mallard heads,
cutting it out, along the dashed skyline.
I search through the trees
to find the ginger cat glow of windows.
A waterproof becomes my home,
following me round like a shadow cocoon.
I left without putting socks on and now
I feel the damp seep under and past my toenails.
The streetlights have replaced the young night sky, 
though it’s summer and I can still find my way.
The constant dripping from my dog nosed hood
blurs this phone like a bubbled barrier
and soon I’m reduced to putting it back.
In the meantime, I’m an outhouse-on-hill
amongst the squared away housing estate.
The raindrops tap my head like tiny door knockers 
and the steady bass kick of my feet
is broken only by the passing buses.

Returning, the watermark of my walk falls to the floor.
The laptop screen outside the window fades,
moving through shades until it switches off to black.
I hang my coat from the bedroom door,
like the flayed skin of history, 
still fresh with a petrichor smell.
A history only just deceased,
waiting to be reborn with the next coming rain.
Time for tomorrow is carved out,
but it brings only a drizzle, no thicket to drench
the soil that yawns worms out of itself.
The train comes and catches the platform people,
wriggling in their shirts stuck to their backs,
with a patch of sweat like yesterday’s dregs
left to reminisce about when the rain poured.",Poem
05/08/2023,Lightbox,"In an art gallery, you stood; there and 
now, stood alone in the drafty silence 
which washed through, room to room,
beaten by the chill of those white walls-

they made the four corners which the
oil faces called home. It was in the dusty
back corner of a city, long forgotten, out
somewhere in Europe. And there, where

with everyone which you locked eyes with
across the street, under the crossing’s light
din, you mistaked people for actors and 
actresses from some noir movie. A memory

that peels at you from inside. Sat up and 
swallowed by the night, together; he would
dig around for another stickered tape. But
now you’re here with only the motionless 

stare of a foreign banker. Abandoned in 
a city you don’t even know the name of.
And the grizzled clouds, closing in, speak
in that old man’s voice. In the courtyard,

you puffed out a ball of smoke, drifting 
upwards and joining the sky, before the
night turned to slate and before the 
coming storm kicked and roared up high.",Poem

18/08/2023,Something Written Down,"It’s natural, after a journey away, to
want to stitch the memory deep; 
when you’ve thrust yourself, your
whole soul, and exposed it like a
heart without any bones to protect it.
You fear, more than death itself, that
the wind might pick it up when you’re
not looking, and in your aged days
you’ll be searching for it in vain, or
worse, that you won’t even think of
looking at all, as if it never even existed. 

That’s why you have to write these 
lines, and be mindfully carefree of 
if they are really “proper” poetry. So 
just write and keep on about St. Bees’ 
sandstone and the way it rubbed 
away under your fingers, about the
waves that crashed as the rain came
as if the sky were shedding tears at
your departure. Just write, just write
about scrambling up Blencathra with
it’s luminous lichen, and of sleepily
counting the Swindale sheep whilst 
pitched high up on Truss Buttress, or
crossing slabs out at Runestone Quarry.

And though it might not be as telling
as a photo or video, nor the poem be
how you intended, hoping it can do 
at least some justice, please don’t
worry yourself that time has run off
with all your belongings. You think
your possessionless but in truth you
have gained a gold more valuable 
than the light of a sunset, and after
you’ve come home, passed out in
your childhood bed, dawn can now
break and whisper you awake to a 
new light where you’ll gain more 
treasures than you thought could
ever exist; all singing arm in arm, 
shoulder to shoulder, friends of the
days in joy, companions of tomorrow.",Poem
21/08/2023,The Numquid,"Go dive deep to the depths, be painted blue, 
in a sea forage clinging to her back.

Ashore, the sun sinks in her broken light.
Night calms, as a humming snore tidal sneaks

to’nother land in search of brighter balm.
Handing an ash tree leaf unto her,

under foliage grins the Numquid.
Resting in  blurred her-

rise on the coming day. Breathing wind,
and riding on, off to the bushy sway

of greenest, lushest place. The willow
hushed and laced a new dream under eyes

the thunder she had drowned. The Numquid,

deep in depths, bids farewell, forgotten sun.",Poem

the dying flowers

beating from the wind
your breath’s sound
a silence unheard
lasting in the air

the pond ripples
as you are swept
out to sea the
water sings lullabies

you must allow
yourself stillness
as the sheep sleep
under the winter moon

soon the ice
stops flowing from
the mountain heights
the rocks remain

lakes freeze tight
around the beating
hearts that slow
like the snowfall

great earth is yearned
for hidden beneath
a lost landscape

yourself stillness
when no rain falls
under forest canopies

the waterfalls begin
to whisper-tepid
their secrets
once again

your arm against 
warming skin
a butterfly goes out
in fresh search

and the daffodils
paint the floor
a house for all
a mirror to the sun

evening opens
it’s bright eyes
the stars look
back in wonder

it already gone

it, about turning up the

quietude. It’s served in
a glass where it can glow
under the shade of the clock.

Washed beneath barrelled
waves, no amount of soft
music, no jazz of such, can

really help much for you to 
take stock of the hour. You
know that youth sits happy, 

curled in evenfall locks,
and it plays away with the 
truth. But, despite all efforts

the time turns and frays as 
the stars reach their chambers,

and each day I ride
it without an inch
of thought. Only now
I gave her my hard
attention. I take
the hot hours easily,
too carefree, and lost,
I am made inside.
So smooth, rising soft,
she glides air-con fresh.
The tarmac is fierce out
there, outside beneath
the last weeks wicked in
heat-enraged summer sun.
She can’t join me here,
I can pause and hide
and count  the minutes 
out. Tomorrow will fall

returns snapping, fall

and I will hear the washing waves
even when they’re turned to frost.

If there is a memory
still to run it’s zoetrope,
it will be yours that will turn 
as the time slips down it’s slope.

black feathers.

such a crowd gather at this house of late;
standing deserted, 
it’s been gifted a great garden,
with a bosom of fruit for every plate.

lingering somber tone,

sick with a warning tipped tongue.",Poem
02/10/2023,Postcards of a Dead Soldier,"I
“These postcards, Captain! Poems! Written, see!”
so cried the soldier boy, with words that formed
like streams in rushed gushes, out prying free.
Whilst knelt, the boy still wept,
and with a hand inside the chest now torn,
he gripped at paper pages that adorned
the dead man’s greyed-out heart.
The fragments bled and bled in ink turned red,
the stamps all faceless, buried by the dirt,
while wiping youthshed tears the boy then said,
“No address. None Sir, none.”
But still the boy could read by moonlit sky
those deathly poems: postcards sans reply,
	once lost, now caught by him.

II
“Oh, leave them be before the winds and rain
come lashing belts on us,” the Captain spoke,
“What else, what else is left for us to gain.”
	“We risk our lives for what?
For poetry, oh save your beating heart.
The time it slips, it fast doth fall apart.”
	“Then go and grant me peace,”
bayed the boy, “this hand from death sings so sweet.
My mind is fixed, my soul entrapped, so go!
Forgotten postcards bind and keep my feet.”
 	The clouds now bent their horns
and thunder claimed it’s darkened sky with fear,
and on horseback the Captain rode his bier
	not knowing death so close.

III
No darkness since that night has screamed as loud,
Lo! send no help, the swansong words inked down
whilst rain did flood and drown that boy who vowed
	to cast those postcards high.
And as he did a raven flew to thee
and took in beak the dead mans’ poetry.
	The flood, in time, gave way
and left the crumbled stone of statues ruined,
the great halls buried deep beneath the mud,
and so too the voice of the land loosened.
	No sound came from the streams,
but somewhere, past grit and forgotten dust,
there lies those postcards which in you they trust-
	there waiting on your breath.",Poem
06/10/2023,Openings,"I have traded it for initiative.
The days buried beneath books that 
left you bruised, and sore to the thought.
The rolling wheel of rising with 
grave-eyes to sleeping halls,
shuffling in on a still dreaming wave.
It coming after evening wicks have
burnt to the morning,
taking glōm in passing-
and the threads are cut short.
I’ve lost a piece somewhere,
trying to walk with the
world in parallel,
but we’re of the same chalk,
all afraid of loosening into
another someone.

I left on foot, in search
of something better, taking turns,
reaching outposts, walking through
thick gorse. Left pinned
by all the mind can offer,
after it all, I am trapped-
as we are, collected in symphony.

Take the sacrifice and stay till the end.
When it’s over and your crown of hope 
lies decaying in the patchwork soil
disfigured without any traces of the past,
thinking over all the places you never
set your feet,

like a river between neighboring beaches.

and in the darkness,
the iris of the eyes opens wide,
blooming
as everything is bridged in the embrace,

and under the touch of her hand,
Sakuntala in plaster rose to stand,
with her love in her mind sent to death.

Long forgotten by The King of her heart,
the royal ring is swept in the swell
of the river, by flowers faded past pastel,
and so, by her tools, she began to chart.

The days stretched over, filling in tired eyes
that opened like petals to see the pale figure
in marble, in kneeled embrace, his love in reprise.

Not all in art, with its silver sheen glow,
is as pure or so true, and so life finds its end

23/11/2023,Under the Ginkgo Tree,"I saw a man walking the lane that cuts
our college in two.
He let himself move without haste
along the cobbles and under the ginkgo tree,
who’s leaves had dappled the stones,
and turned them to an autumnal sea. 

His beret, rounded, flat and grey,
like a meadow mushroom upon his head,
turned to seek through the gates
a sight of the university, old in its way.
Perhaps, I wondered, he had once worn
my boots, or my jumper and coat. 
Maybe it was here he founded his roots.

And under that hat, its shadow cast so dim,
as dusk floated over, just finding its place,
I glanced at a face that looked 
as if made paper thin. In thirty-odd years,

fair and blue, frozen in a wooden pose,
singing as your hair blew away
the woes of the new day to the wind.

A blind bird settled, still wet, at your base,
sat at your toes, and so with kind words
like lace you nestled that bird, brushing ice
from its wings and from its nose.

Blushing twice, you saw it bring
jambul fruit in its poor beak.
And in a hush, under the lamb-wool,
under a thunder’s peak and a sky 
rushed with beetroot rain,
you came and gave shelter to her;
you held close to her with heat to restitute.

In that flame of rest, of a morning sun
neat to its warming wave,
you awoke with the saved bird,
now fleeting from your naked breast. 
And with the arrow drew, 
its tip held to your sacred chest,
you fell with heart engraved, 
blurred with the swell of tears 
as the bird began to depart.
 
By the parting light, a bluebell dove
clears the heights, charting in flight to find
you: the nude mountain. 
Left like a hollow rind,
you watch the hues amount in the well 
of your glowing mind lit in all-colour. ",Poem

With heart sword-crossed and split in two,
the knight now arched to find a face
that beared him down with heavenly grace-
the knight returned eyes seeing through.

A well of fire in feeling grew
and sound lay dead on ears withdrew,
the knight remained an image in space-
“Arise, my knight.”

In feigning domnei never true,

sunk beneath its candle.
A hunter burns whilst
wrestling the desert’s sand 
like a falling star.

The wheel, for now, has stopped
and no water flows beyond the bowl.
Two sets of eyes meet in an envelope
made out of elsewhere.
Here, for a brief moment, they exist,
living with more knowledge

to find a new way?",Poem
13/01/2024,Illuminating,"A lightbulb lit becomes the centre
though here love holds little.
Love is lost between bedding,
twisted by what we see to be
time stood still.
Take spent sand and look to love-
no sudden switching-on catches
the heart.

The sun is slow in rising,
roused by the beating.
The flowers find pure tones
and trace lovers.
Listen close and clear answers
will grow.

Love is no light nor a point;
more a Signac, swiftly moving,
dot to dot,
affected by each flurry of paint.

Fast you’ll fall like young rose-heads
by loves resting bed,
weighted by the beauty.
The roots have formed
and found a place a paradise
in dawn’s raptured glow.

Bearing themselves nude,
bringing life with only love to offer,
love becomes loving,
spread out in a sea of drifting days.",Poem
16/01/2024,Conchiglie,"I wish that someday
I should become like conchiglie,
and be a vessel for flavour.

I mean that in the most
serious mindfulness, and
with no irony in my eye.

I wish to be like conchiglie,
so that the durum wheat 
runs deep with wonder;
to be saturated in salt.

And like the mollusc shelled
sea snail, may I go slow
through the ocean of my life,
and never find my cusp or well.

And after I have left this
world behind, may my shell
be soaked in sauce,
rich with a warming smell,
and be found anew by a mitching
child in some sandy ground.

So don’t sneer quite so freely
when I say to you in earnest:
I wish to be conchiglie.",Poem
21/01/2024,Audience,"Tonight a theatre will
be swollen in orchestral sound.
Elderly faces still.

Musicians playing grave,
their eyes focused with wearied years,
the practice sunk in them.

Then instruments will stop
and make way for the audience
all clapping out of sync.

Is this the best they can
repay? Maestri aside, I mean 
the art itself. So hoarse;

the human voice in its
reply to life can’t seem to match
the beauty. Who am I

to try to write in words
responses to the world?
A friend, he said: the mind

is complex, nature stands
no competition when it’s called
to arms. And so, perhaps 

it is it that should clap
when we are stood in the sublime
of mountains and the seas.",Poem
11/03/2024,You Must Believe in Spring,"There are days in the future
that are holding an old couple in 
a house, beachside and built strong,
a home filled with artifacts,
each telling fairy tales full of an
enduring love.

There are days in the future
when the coffee will cool on the hob
as they sit with their eyes sea-stuck
waiting for a dolphin to come by,
to wave hello.

There are days in the future
shuffled like a deck of cards,
dealt out to where all you could say 
about the week is that love won
and the score was lost.

There are days in the future
when a sea breeze whispers
a book of youth only to be muffled
by the barricade of a hundred year old
Irish blanket with the wool still soft.

There are days in the future 
that mellow into nights dressed in
a cold from long ago and 
a double set of shoes walk
to the warmth of a pub, wetting 
lips with pints.

There are days in the future
in which the daffodils will grow
an arm's length from the back door
and be lifted to be adored in vases,
put atop stacks of leftover books,
scattered like crumbs in the kitchen.

There are days in the future
where I cannot find myself 
anywhere but resting with you
and your head on my chest
and my heart beating piano with love songs.",Poem
15/03/2024,Old Geography Coat,"I see him in the cloud fog
in his old geography coat
like a bent beast, a wild hog.

The old man of Braeriach
is there in front of me, cloud
and rain heavy on his back.

Seeing right through his spare ghost
skin, hanging loose in a marble
veil, I see the innermost:

his time-tested soul, dying.
But where is my coat? I guess
the morning sky’s been lying.

Hair wet-wicked, a bog land,
feet struck through, I’ll find a pub
and sit waiting for God’s hand.",Poem
01/04/2024,On Love,"To write in love is to will the words 
I love you
into an eternal existence,		
from being held in the heart’s heat to
being heard.				
It is to explore in ink the depths   	
of a cave				
and carve out a gemstone glittering,	
as it has always done, demanding	
air to breath.				
When a wild love leaves the mouth,		
	bounding out,
bright amazement appears at the sight
of the symmetry of it, as if
we thought love
in all light, could never warm our house.

When our awe fades, we find that this love 
lived entwined
with us all along and a gust comes
and glances a thought: the fickle forked
prong that stabs
at the sweet meat of the heart in love.
	In the mind,
the whispering thought wobbles love-hope,
loosens the taught ropes holding it down,
	teething through,
and it is only then that love’s weight 
is felt true.
Bright amazement appears at the sight
of the symmetry of it, as if
we thought love
in all light, could never warm our house.",Poem
10/04/2024,Raspberry Croissant,"Waking with weeping eyes
just because the sun’s too bright.
So you shut the blinds,
cross the street for a croissant and coffee.
The day’s a mirror image
but with minor specks:
dust on the glass.
So you sit and sip at your desk:
computer, monitor, keyboard, mouse.

With fingers like talons,
you tear at the croissant
as the crisp flakes-thin fall in your lap.
Gasping,
the inside is swimming in raspberry jam.
But it’s so much sweeter than you thought.",Poem
11/04/2024,April Pub Scene,"The pub has burst, the people are
pouring out,
with bubbles rising in their beers.
Sat outside:
they’re parked on the kerb and bathing
like pigeons.

Past six: and April’s breath is a
cool eighteen.
The glasses chatter as they knock
and canon
off the cobblestone, wetted with
the wheat beer.

Under an awning-sky awake 
in deep pink,
April promises to pull them
to summer.
So the pliant have walked away 
from their work
and bask lazy like cats under 
April’s beam.",Poem
19/04/2024,Venice,"For Venice, the vice, between lips
a lone rose,
as the air acts its ballet through
the arcades,
and by peach-kissed sky the square blooms
with love’s blows. 

For the heart in haste can’t wait for 
Saint Mark’s Day
so in whisper-soft eve they dance
and drape arms
like soft cloth around each other
as they frey

and weave and waltz on until one.
Then Morn steers
her misty ship to port as red
Venice leans
longing, stretched to lucent sea, with 
waning tears.",Poem
06/08/2024,Evening Tide,"I pledge my love to you.
To you I’m knocked and kneeling-
exhausted, with mine heart beating
rosy hues.
My rivers swell and swelter
as I’m washed up in you, lying in the swash,
presented to you in love’s naked lassitude.
And if Fortune marries my cheek to yours,
let me barrage you with my every breath.
Beneath your shelter I’ll cling,
and in my love you’ll find my servitude. ",Poem
28/09/2024,Vicar,"I dipped into an Irish 
pub in 'Pool's sweet streets
My back bent, mule-heavy,
my smoking breath in heat.

The barmaid lost her ear 
In the Anglo accent
Of my asking but soon
The stout's tap handle lent.

And in a nook I kindled,
Sat besides a vicar
staring vacant, reverent
in his golden liquor.

The whisky washed his throat
and stout warmed my cheek,
so we sat in silence 
each evening through the week.

One dusk drawn eve he gave
his word, sloshed in his speech,
I’m leaving - out he went
to the street having preached.

And so I went for years, 
called to go drink alone,
without that drunk Vicar,
devout to the pub’s drone.

Each winter the sea’s howls
tore blue through Liverpool,
biting between red bricked
houses and the old school.",Poem
21/10/2024,The Writer & Reader,"I am the writer
You are the reader
We are the fleeting cliché moment
Forgotten in an hour a day a month a year
We are the locked interlocutors
Never to hear each other
Like a voice-missile near miss

I am the writer
You are the reader
The one who picked me up
Plucked me out from the myriad of possibilities
We are the ones who cannot turn the page
Alone we face the words

We are commerce’s soft baby
The coffee houses’ resident arsehole
Proud of our stained pages

Do you? Do you?
I can't remember sneezing achoo
So I must've never been sick

Don't believe me? Fuck you, suck my dick!

God made me redundant, lost my job
Guess its to test my faith
Now I hope I don't break my hip 
Whilst fighting down the mob
Whilst wearing a t shirt saying ""I heart Steve Jobs""
Now looky here at how you've smeared
My old money designer gear
With your bloody pagan ear.

And I'm sure you think
How you're so much more cleverer
For telling me off cos I leathered her
But God made her decide to leave

Just another test up His sleeve;
Like those children on the news
Rained on, blown up by blighty's bombs.

And why should I believe you

Catch the eternal breath of all
In the winds my voice will stand tall.

That cells unconscious

Intertwined DNA which
We today can alter and
Change if it so falters.

The rhetoric in the boozer
Has become one of winners
And of losers of talk gone
Toxic and fallen from the
Grace of seeing face to face.

Turn into a weapon
And been upon the
Point of fire of burnt
Tongues scolded by
Dogma so goodbye

Be the next England

By company name,

Only one cup is orange,
My favourite colour,
So I favour it
For my morning coffee binge.

It must align with my self,

Such that it's not on the shelf.

Coffee cup made Holy Grail.",Poem

Past each day's sun rise and set
Let my wise side pause to dog-ear those days most precious.

Outside a pub in a town he called planned.
Lord Kitchener's grandson said
My working hard would give our country
An upper hand.
I called his town a meal deal supper
Only that it's like spam and has been canned.
So I drank my drink and took his too
And that's when I saw the sword he drew.
Lord Kitchener's grandson slashed my wages
With a quick one two
I was his foil and this we both knew.
So I walked home happy with the money
To buy a couple pints
In my adidas kicks
And to iron the creases in my Manchester kecks.
Sure my pockets had holes in but I had three fleeces
And at least Lord Kitchener's grandson can never fleece me of my niece.",Poem
27/01/2025,Mr Blue Suit,"Mr Blue Suit with his navy tie
Just lost his wife
His blessed Britannia
She's living a new life
With the young student down the road
She loves Her
She's inside you wife Britannia
In ways you couldn't describe
And no amount of pride will bring her back
You can try and bribe but you've lost
Your Britannia she has a new bride

Mr Blue Suit what about your young ones
Your youthful ties have turned their necks
They've given papa his goodbye pecks
And I hear they're having happy babies
Your old wife and Her
Jobless babies still on soft smash
Avocado babies suckling on coffee
Refusing to wear the sash
I saw your old Britannia and Her
Crying in the museum till her tears made a sea
I saw them swim in an embrace
And go home for afternoon tea.

Then I watched as you stood outside
Face pressed to the window pane
With an expression grotesque yelling hell for the ages
For past ways back in the days without gays
And that's when it rained
Mr Blue Suit you're soaked right through
Go home now
Even the clouds have had enough of you.

But this is my home you cry
With your head held up bleating slurs to the sky
The doors locked
The pistols cocked
And you've been knocked
So out you go shipped on a plane
Back to a place you've never been
All because of your race you've never seen
Mr Blue Suit your navy has sunk you.

Don't fret I heard your King will save you
Just as God did
Scooped up into mummy's arms
There there baby Blue Suit
The monarchy's got you
Open wide
Here comes the private train toot toot
Oh what's that don't worry about your bride
Here's some pocket money for you to hide
Come on stop it honey don’t cry
Mummy monarchy is by your side.

I thought Mr Blue Suit was tucked up in bed
Turns out the reaper spared his head
Now there's riots calling for more people to be dead
Looks like business is booming
And the bank's showing growth
The landlord's taken Ken's roof
Look how his envy grows 
Just another fuming oaf

Poor Britannia can't file for divorce
The lawyers got her neck by force
Mr Blue Suit has her penned
That’s when I saw him lean over to whisper
We're in this to the end.",Poem
24/02/2025,Our George,"George is sat scrolling the web
Eating lunch with his laptop on his knees
All while picking at olives with a tiny sword
Our George is sieving through jobs
Tap after tap
Educated is how we might describe him
He says he felt gagged
By a garter that left him trapped
George is in search to reclaim gold
And now he's found a dragon
A dragon who after lunch often naps.
With no other option to survive,
Our George sends off his CV and application
And soon received a phone call 
From a man named Clive

Clive said in a voice that bellows through
Arrive sharpish in attire befitting of a fine fellow
So George got a new tie from M&S
Stripped with yellow
On the train George grows nervous
Fearful of his new dragon test
I'm no hero, he thinks
His blood’s not blue and to kill a dragon?
He hasn't got the faintest clue.

Our George finds his way to the pearly gates
Of an office block
Made of neo-classical rock
With a gargantuan sign in red hung above:
Slayers Ltd.
Now he's really turned to timid jelly.
Walking into the reception 
He say he's here for Mr Clive
Slightly yelling from his belly.
Take a seat Mr...
It's George, just George.

Called into Mr Clive's office
George stutters in sitting standing sitting
Awkwardly hanging out his open hand to bare
Like a sad balloon floating in midair
Please sit, grumbles the man
Though more an ogre
With a forehead like a great boulder.
Our George fixes his eye on a picture to his side
Ah my great great greatest grandfather
Mr Clive begins
He built that there henge, my grandfather the Lord Ralph Tarquin

With that the questions started
And as each barreled from Mr Clive's mouth
George felt the silence like a precipice 
As if hanging off a cliff as a small mouse 
Oh how he wished it'd be soon finished.

In the end George slumps his way out
Feeling as if black eyed and broken ribbed
Like a boxer who'd lost his bout.
But by surprise the next week up pops on his phone
An email: we are pleased to inform you
that you must immediately leave your home.
So George readies a bag
Calls up a landlord and pays for rent
At a rate much more than he'd like to have spent.

On Monday morning out he goes with Cheerios
Breakfast on the go
With the coffee swishing in his cup
As he rides the train to find his foe.
The dragon, says his line manager on Teams
Is in a folder labelled Silene
So through the labyrinth George journeys 
Passing files and folders 
Written in long forgotten acronyms and numbers
His semiotics from undergrad guides him through
And he lumbers on sword in hand
Until upon the dreaded beast he lands.

Our George wasn't quite cut out for this
But still firm he now stands and makes his lunge
The dragon dodges moving swift
It drags it tail slowly first then whips it round
Striking George sending him tumbling to the ground
It stands atop it's great asset hoard
Glistening in golden light
Stocks and bonds of every type

But George gets up and prays to his Lord
Oh heavenly father who art in heaven
Summon for my union my fellow brethren
At that the door burst open
The floor floods with workers of every nation
The dragon hastens to guard his plunder
And before he can fire
Nor beg for salvation 
Their swords strike the dragon's heart
From the treasure each worker now take their rightful part
And departs this dragon-lair
In search of a pub to drink till dark
This solstice eve the beer garden
Basks in the remains of the setting sun
And St George now knighted drinks with friends
Till last orders and all are warm and numb.",Poem

The one that the university never said
Would keep us sane 
From our toes to our heads

To drink more tea and eat more scones.",Poem
21/03/2025,Resistance Factor,"Just don't exceed the minimum yield stress
Else they'll go shouting to the press
And you'll have a bout on your hands
A great old mess
Don't let them lay out the plans
Erase and keep them plain
Don't let them stay out in bands
Round them up and tase them bone deep

The minimum yield stress is codified in law
And today you saw the bona fide voice
Shouting behind the newspaper door
Bolted shut braced and reinforced
To sound out the poor
Shouting at the bruise maker paid for
Money rolling over money
The hounds are out in the inner the city
Drinking in pubs playing good chat old dog
Drinking gritty stouts for pitty

The banker's boys are out negging again
Made of highland farmers ground up
Cut and lined in gilets
Out to rut in full season
And the force is building up
Any minute now and it'll burst the lesion
The sewage works will fail first
And all the fat will shirk wages
As they commodify the hearse and all the rats.

The resistance factor is to be applied
The strength requirement is an actor
Supplied throughout the length of the country
Branded in bootstraps and lies
It starts with a few to doubt the strength
Of the country

Before cutting down the royal cunt tree",Poem

I peeped it through the internet 
Looking for a few words

Craning my head behind the TV set
Peering down wires
For a poem to set my heart on fire
And there I found my desire
Pulling apart invisible air waves
I read a poem that then left me
I was stranded but feeling pretty smart

And my phone flicked
And buzzed and beeped
It whirled with deft glee
Then I read a text 
Watched a jet plane land on top of a jeep
I read a post online
And copped a new top that looked pretty neat
Wait a second where's that poem
Did I read it in a book
Is it lost down the sofa seat
I swear I read a poem
Now I've lost it down some online nook
How'd it go again

Maybe I can recite it to a friend
I read a poem
It was online for free",Poem

As water touched and nursed
Her lips swelled and the water trickled
Through her.
Her strength grew as days passed
As suns and moons ran past
And her lungs breathed and soon

Whistling to summer's folkish tune

Holding tight to each brick
